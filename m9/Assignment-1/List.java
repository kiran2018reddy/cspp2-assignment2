     * We need to create an array of ints to store the items
     * added to the list.

     * Why private access specifier and why not public?
     * Well, we don't want the array to be manipulated by
     * methods that are outside the List class.
     * If you allow methods outside the List class to manipulate
     * the array then there is a possibility of having a corrupted
     * list i.e., a list with incorrect items.
     * This is not desirable and so having private access specifer

     * Let's think about the size of the list by comparing it to the
     * length of the array. Do they mean the same?
     * No, Array length signifies the maximum number of items
     * you can store in the list. Whereas, the size of the list
     * denotes the number of items in the list. Makes sense?
     * Here is an example:
     * array = [1,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
     * The length of the array is 10 and size is 3.
     * This means you can store 10 items in the list and
     * currently it has 3 items.
     * So, to keep track of the size we need a variable called size
     * Again, we use private as we don't want that size variable
     * to be accessed by the methods that are outside of the List class.
